This is stub for Hitach h8s 2633 procesor.
I am currently working on it, but it seems to be quite stable.
I load this stub into EVB using HDI debuger.
It works with gdb-5.0 under linux
I am now testing it, soon I'll finish version ready for ROM.

This stub uses application stack now (maybe more than 1k)!

I would welcome feedback on this stub.
