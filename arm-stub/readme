StronARM to GNU DEBUGGER Adaption (generic parts)
=========================================================================
This directory contains files for a generic gdb adaption for strongarm
prcessors. The remote.c is the hostside communication stub for serial 
and udp ethernet connections. The udp part is new.

The targetside stub handles a packet based io. The serial packet handler
is not really tested (sorry). The udp communication is ok and tested.
The udp stuff may be taken from our bootstrap loader which handles
bootp/tftp. There is an older version at the boot directory.
